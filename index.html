    <p>My name is Erin Stairs and I'm 20 years old. I have always had a passion for photography since I got my first
      camera for Christmas when I was about 12 years old. But due to school, hobbies and just having a social life, I
      never really found the time to develop my technical skills. Then, after graduating high scool, I took a year off
      to travel and found that same passion again. I took pictures throughout Costa Rica, Florida and the Carribbean
      and ended up making videos of my travels as well. I still wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my life, but I
      knew what my passions were and knew I wanted to utilize them. I found the Interactive Media Design program and
      instantly knew it was what I wanted to do. It would allow me to get real training in photography and videography,
      but also learn new skills in the design field. Throughout the past year I have grown to love other forms of
      design, but I think I will always be the most passionate about photography. This website is to try and provide
      inspiration for people, of any age, to pursue photography, because I know not everyone is as lucky as I was to
      find inspiration through travel. And due to traveling, I am now able to find inspiration in every day life as
      well. </p>
